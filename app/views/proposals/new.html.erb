<h1>New proposal</h1>
This work area is for students ready to begin writing a proposal to present to their teacher or guidance councillor.

However, it may also be used by teachers who wish to build a template for specific project types.

The proposal builds on the challenge you either created, or borrowed from someone else. Unlike the challenge, the proposal will eventually become a contract between you and the school. It's what you say you are going to do.
